# fzb-framework
Simple PHP application framework

FZB Framework is a lightweight web framework that implements modern PHP 8.1 features. It provides a router, input validator, template renderer, DB abstration layer, and lightweight ORM. It currently is designed as a drop-in framework for deploying on shared/dedicated Apache servers, but will eventually include the ability to be run as a stand-alone application server.

Note: "fzb-framework" is a work-in-progress collection of test cases.  In the future it will give the developer the ability to start a new web project with a git clone, and will feature several sample project structures.
